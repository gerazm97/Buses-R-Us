# Buses-R-Us


Buses R Us is an android app developed in the Software Construction course at UBC.The project was made with the help of some instructors' code and they specifially asked to not distribute the code with anybody, however if you are interested to learn on how the app works we can arrange something. 

The app consists on marking stops and bus routes on a map of all the Greater Vancouver Transit System. It retrieves real time data to plot user’s and buses’ location while also indicating the user’s nearest stop. When one clicks a stop it shows all the buses that pass through that stop as well as showing the routes, current buses location and arrival time. 

Before I started the project it was required to design a UML diagram in UMLet to facilitate the construction of the app. Afterwards I was required to develop all the back-end code of the app while the instructors' code was mainly the fron-end of the app. I had to perform JUnit tests that had at least 95%+ of code coverage to ensure the functionality of the app. To retrieve the real time data I had to get a key for the Translink API and parsed their JSON data. All the code had to be pushed using Git to a now terminated student GitHub account. At the end of the project we had to do an app demo.


Again if you are intersted of knowing more about this project do not hesitate to ask questions. If you desire an app demo that will also be possible however I may not be able to show all the code just the one created by me.
