# Buses-R-Us


Buses R Us is an android app developed in the Software Construction course. The app consists on marking stops and bus routes on a map of all the Greater Vancouver Transit System. It retrieves real time data to plot user’s and buses’ location while also indicating user’s nearest stop. As the project was made directly for the University of British Columbia I can't distribute the code, however if you are intersted to learn on how the app work, I am sure we can arrange something.
