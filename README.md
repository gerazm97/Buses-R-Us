# Buses-R-Us


Buses R Us is an android app developed in the Software Construction course at UBC. The app consists on marking stops and bus routes on a map of all the Greater Vancouver Transit System. It retrieves real time data to plot user’s and buses’ location while also indicating the user’s nearest stop. The project was made with the help of some instructors' code and they specifially asked to not distribute the code with anybody, however if you are interested to learn on how the app works we can arrange something.
